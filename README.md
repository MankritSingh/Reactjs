Hello Friends,
I am starting my journey of learning React today. I am referring to the course by Stephen Grinder(link:https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/)  
In this Repo, I will be documenting my learnings along with all of my React Projects.  
The learning will not be only limited to the course, I will be exploring everything that catches my attention or creates a stir in my curious mind  
and also filling concept and syntax-related gaps, for example, some important Javascript concepts, Cool CSS hacks, etc.  
If you are also starting your learning journey of React or Web Development, then let's do it together :)  
Always open to peer learning so do contact me if you have anything to share or any advice for me  
Happy Learning
